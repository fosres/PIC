Heron's Formula Folder

Written by Tanveer Salim

for PIC 10A

This folder has heron.cpp, which

calculates the area of triangle 

using Heron's formula.

Terms 

and 

How Program Works:

double a, b, c = each length of one of the

sides of the triangle.

double s = semiperimeter of triangle 

s = (a + b + c)/2

Area = sqrt( s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c) )
